Disable the built-in front-end search capabilities of WordPress.


== Description ==

Prevent WordPress from allowing and handling any search requests for the site. Specifically, this plugin:

* Prevents the search form from appearing if the theme uses the standard `get_search_form()` function to display the search form.
* Prevents the search form from appearing if the theme uses a searchform.php template
* Prevents the search item from appearing in the admin tool bar when shown on the front-end.
* Disables the search widget.
  * Removes the Search widget from the list of available widgets
  * Deactivates any search widgets currently in use in any sidebars (they are hidden, not deleted; they'll still be in the proper locations if this plugin gets deactivated)
* With or without the search form, the plugin prevents any direct or manual requests by visitors, via either GET or POST requests, from actually returning any search results.
* Submitted attempts at a search will be given a 404 File Not Found response, rendered by your site's 404.php template, if present.

The plugin only affects search on the front-end of the site. It does not disable searching in the admin section of the site.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `disable-search.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this disable the search capabilities in the admin section of the blog? =

No.

= Will this prevent Google and other search engines from searching my site? =

No. This only disables WordPress's capabilities with regards to search.

= Why do I still see a search form on my site despite having activated this plugin? =

The most likely cause for this is a theme that has the markup for the search form hardcoded into one or more of the theme's template files (excluding searchform.php). This is generally frowned upon nowadays (the theme should be calling `get_search_form()` or using searchform.php to get the search form). There is no way for this plugin to prevent this hardcoded form from being displayed.

However, even if this is the case, the form won't work (thanks to this plugin), but it will still be displayed.

= Does this plugin include unit tests? =

Yes.
