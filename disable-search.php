Version: 1.4.1
Plugin URI: http://coffee2code.com/wp-plugins/disable-search/
Author: Scott Reilly
Author URI: http://coffee2code.com/
License: GPLv2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Description: Disable the built-in front-end search capabilities of WordPress.

Compatible with WordPress 3.6 through 4.1+.

=>> Read the accompanying readme.txt file for instructions and documentation.
=>> Also, visit the plugin's homepage for additional information and updates.
=>> Or visit: https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-search/

TODO:
	* Rather than responding to search requests with a 404 error, allow response to be configurable:
		* 404
		* 404 with custom error message (e.g. Search has been disabled)
		* Redirect to a post or page
		* Redirect back home (but set some sort of flag that can be detected so the theme can display a message)
		* Act as if search was performed but no results were found
	* Filter to allows searching to be conditionally enabled (query obj as arg)
	* Allow front-end searches for admins (and/or all logged in users?), via a Reading option and/or filters
