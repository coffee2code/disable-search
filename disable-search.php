Version: 1.0
Plugin URI: http://coffee2code.com/wp-plugins/disable-search
Author: Scott Reilly
Author URI: http://coffee2code.com
Description: Disable the search capabilities of WordPress.

Prevent WordPress from allowing and servicing any search requests for the blog.  Specifically, this plugin:

* Prevents the search form from appearing (if the theme is using the standard <code>get_search_form()</code>
  function to retrieve and display the search form).
* Prevents the Search widget from displaying the search form.
* With or without the search form, the plugin prevents any direct or manual requests by visitors, via either
  GET or POST requests, from actually returning any search results.
* Submitted attempts at a search will be given a 404 File Not Found response, rendered by your sites 404.php
  template, if present.

Compatible with WordPress 2.6+, 2.7+, 2.8+.
